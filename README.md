# SEVEN SEGMENT DISPLAY CONTROLLER LIBRARY README
Welcome!
This is my solution for controlling a seven segment display with multiple digits.
The library is able to display an int, float, string or your own symbol. You can also enable/disable digits and let them blink.
Feel free to use it anywere in your projects.
Cheers, Donut Studio!

[Check out the wiki](https://github.com/Donut-Studio/Arduino-Seven-Segment-Controller/wiki)

# Features
- control a seven segment display directly with you ATmega without having to use another controller
- display integers, ~~floats~~(wip), strings and your own symbols
- enable/disable digits
- enable/disable blinking on digits
- shift the display to the right and left (scroll effect)


***
# TODO
- displaying a float is currently wip

# Quick Installation
1. download the repository and extract it into the libraries folder of the Arduino IDE
2. start your Arduino IDE and open one of the example sketches at `File/Examples/DonutStudioSevenSegment/...`
3. connect the pins of the display with your controller
4. upload the sketch
